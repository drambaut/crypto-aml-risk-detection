# Bitcoin Transaction Fraud Detection: Summary Report

## Key Findings

### Data Analysis
- The dataset contains Bitcoin transactions with both labeled and unlabeled data, representing a real-world scenario where not all transactions are initially classified.
- Network analysis revealed significant patterns in transaction behavior, with certain nodes showing higher connectivity and transaction volumes.
- Feature importance analysis identified key indicators of fraudulent behavior, including:
  - Transaction frequency and volume patterns
  - Network centrality metrics
  - Temporal transaction patterns
  - Graph-based features like in-degree and out-degree

### Model Performance
- The semi-supervised learning approach achieved robust performance in detecting fraudulent transactions:
  - High precision in identifying known fraud patterns
  - Effective generalization to unlabeled transactions
  - Balanced performance across different transaction types
- The final model, trained on both original and predicted labels, showed improved stability and reliability.

## Modeling Approach

### Semi-Supervised Learning Strategy
1. **Feature Extraction**
   - Graph-based features from transaction networks
   - Temporal features from transaction patterns
   - Network centrality metrics
   - Dimensionality reduction using SVD for efficient representation

2. **Two-Stage Modeling**
   - First Stage: Semi-supervised model to label unknown transactions
     - Uses Label Propagation for initial labeling
     - Leverages network structure and known labels
   - Second Stage: Final model using all available labels
     - Random Forest classifier for robust predictions
     - Combines original and predicted labels for training

3. **Model Validation**
   - Cross-validation on labeled data
   - Performance metrics including precision, recall, and ROC AUC
   - Feature importance analysis for model interpretability

## Application in AML Monitoring System

### Real-World Implementation
1. **Transaction Monitoring**
   - Real-time scoring of new transactions
